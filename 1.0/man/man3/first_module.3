korobcom This is head function in this program, it's solving square equation by getting coefficients (head, second and free) of inputing equation and changes variables x1 and x2 with 1st and 2nd roots of equation\&. the formulas in variant of a!=0, b!=0,c!=0: $ x_1 = \frac{-b-\sqrt{b^2-4*a*c}}{2a} $ and $ x_2 = \frac{-b+\sqrt{b^2-4*a*c}}{2a} $

Also it return char values '1','2','0' and 'i', where is: '1' - means that this equation have only one root and it is in x1 variable\&. '2' - means that this equation have two roots in x1 and x2 variable respectively\&. '0' - means that this equation don't have any roots! 'i' - means that this equation have infinite number of roots\&.
